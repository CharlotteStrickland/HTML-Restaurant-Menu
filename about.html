    <img src="assets/images/about.jpg" alt="About">
    <p>Our owner is Bob Belcher who decided that he was going to get into cooking Thai food after many years of owning a burger joint. He has become a well known name for many of people around the area and is the place to eat at with the family. His flagship restaurant was in Nashville, NC and he soon opened one in Wilson, Rocky Mount and his newest in Knightdale, NC. Bob's family is also apart of the restaurant as they come up with a food of the day menu and they like to share their laughter and happiness with their customers!</p>
